# SimulinkCoSimulationExample
Examples of Co-Simulation with Simulink.

This example uses the ZeroMQ library to implement co-simulation in Simulink. The project includes three examples:

- Co-simulation between Simulink and a separate executable   
- Co-simulation between two Simulink models in two independent MATLAB sessions 
- Co-simulation between a Simulink model and models running on local parallel worker
